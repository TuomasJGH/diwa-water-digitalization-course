## Project Statement and Objective

### Issue
Climate change impacts in Finland disrupt historical agricultural conditions. Increasing temperatures cause shorter winters with less snowcover, which in turn decreases the effect of the groundwater-replenishing water pulse generated by snowmelt. Fewer water resources, low precipitation during crop development and an already short growing season result in very precarious agricultural conditions.

Improved precipitation estimates are required to improve water management in agricultural conditions. Precipitation is a crucial source of agricultural water resources and a clear indicator of local water availability, and it is expected to change variably across Finland. Therefore, historical precipitation patterns and events should be analyzed for the change that has already occurred in order to estimate which regions will experience challenges or potential prospects related to water resource availability.

### Approach

Historical precipitation patterns are analyzed using the Standardized Precipitation Index SPI (McKee et al., 1993). It has been widely used to analyze precipitation deviations during a given time period with a given accumulation period. SPI determines how precipitation during the accumulation period differs from the mean of the time period.

SPI with different accumulation periods are noted as SPI-n, where n is the number of months included in the accumulation period, often in the range of 1 to 12. SPI with shorter accumulation periods are better at describing short-term events, while longer accumulation periods describe long-term phenomena.

### Objective
The objective is to construct a digital tool that is able to analyze historical precipitation and produce insights into hydrological conditions across Finland using the Standardized Precipitation Index. This tool processes openly available gridded precipitation data, and produces map views and tabled results in different locations and timescales based on user input.

## Data Source
Finnish Meteorological Insitute offers gridded observation data on their [website.](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/gridded-observations-on-aws-s3) The format for these files is NetCDF, and each file contains daily records for a meteorological variable. The grid resolution is one km^2, and areas falling outside of Finland are masked. Observations are available for years 1961 to 2025, with new years appended as their data is available.

## Methodology
The tool begins by requesting parameters from the user, such as the time period, the accumulation period and the desired map visualizations and indicator values (full list to be determined!)

The tool accesses FMI records using an URL and downloads an user-determined selection of NetCDF files on precipitation.

The tool then distinguishes grid cells describing Finland, and calculates the user-given SPI time series for each cell according to the accumulation period. SPI events crossing given thresholds are logged into cell-specific lists, and 

## Repository description
This repository is made available to (eventually) include the SPI from gridded precipitation tool as a single file, as well as split into its functions for modular implementation. In addition, a walkthrough file is included to reproduce a set of results with thoroughly commented code.

## Results
The tool outputs map visualizations of Finland and result tables with indicators describing the precipitation patterns in the selected time period and with the given accumulation period.
